# Every Layout

This is a collection of Styled Components for the awesome [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/), by [Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks) & [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/andybelldesign)

Here's an excerpt from [](https://every-layout.dev/) to explain why these components are important:

> ## Relearn CSS layout
>
> If you find yourself wrestling with CSS layout, it’s likely you’re making decisions for browsers they should be making themselves. Through a series of simple, composable layouts, Every Layout will teach you how to better harness the built-in algorithms that power browsers and CSS.
> Employing algorithmic layout design means doing away with @media breakpoints, “magic numbers”, and other hacks, to create context-independent layout components. Your future design systems will be more consistent, terser in code, and more malleable in the hands of your users and their devices.
